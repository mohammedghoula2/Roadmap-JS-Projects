## About

The **Roadmap JavaScript Projects** repository serves as a collection of different JavaScript projects that aim to enhance my skills as I follow a JavaScript learning path. Each project is designed to reinforce various JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and more complex tasks such as handling asynchronous code.

## Projects List

This folder includes the following projects:

1. **Task Tracker**: A simple task management app where you can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
2. **Custom Dropdown Menu**: A custom dropdown menu where the header text updates in real-time when items are selected.



## Technologies Used

Each project in this repository uses different technologies, but all of them are built using:

- **HTML5**: For structure and layout of the app.
- **CSS3**: For styling the app and making it visually appealing.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic functionality and logic.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons (used in some of the projects for buttons or UI elements).

Some projects may also use additional libraries or APIs (such as a weather API in the Weather App).

## Installation

To set up the projects locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammedghoula2/Roadmap-JS-Projects.git
